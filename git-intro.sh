# Before starting, we need to provide some credentials.
# Make sure they match your credential on GitHub if you want to use it later on.
# We only need to do this step once, so skip if you have already setup git correctly.

git config --global user.email "change to your email!!!"
git config --global user.name "change to the username of your Github account!!!"

# Check that your info is correct.

# Exploring the basics of Git using a with a small project.

mkdir my_local_repo
cd my_local_repo
touch README.txt

# Now make some changes to README.txt using a text editor.

# Now we initialize our git repository and check its status.

git init
git status

# For our first commit we need to tell *git* which files we want to track.
# With git add we tell which files git will take a snapshot of.

git add *.txt
git status

# Now we can commit our project and check the status again.
# Always make the commit-message somewhat meaningful, then it is easier to track your changes.
# A commit takes a snapshot of the added files, and stored them.

git commit -m "My first local commit"
git status

# There is also a log.

git log

# And a short version of the log.

git log --oneline

# Now, add some more changes with a text editor to README.txt.

# To see what youâ€™ve changed but not yet staged, type git diff with no other arguments.

git diff

# Take a snapshot with git commit and look at the log.

git commit -a -m "My second commit" # (without staging like *git add* first)
git log

# Create a new file.

touch hello.txt

# Make some changes to the file using a text editor.

# Add the file to the staging area and commit.

git add hello.txt
git commit -m "added python file"
git status

# Assume we did not want the hello.py file in our repository.
# First remove the actual file. Afterwards remove the file from the repository.

rm hello.txt
git rm hello.txt
git commit -m "removed python file"
git log

### Branching

# Branching allows you to make a copy of your existing code, and do changes on that copy.
# You can always quickly swap back to your original copy if you need that version.
# With this approach, you can keep a working version of the code available, while doing changes to another version.
# It is nice for testing new features. It becomes essential when you work with production code (e.g. operational flood forecasting model), 
# where you always need to be able to fix bugs in the operational version while working on new features.
# Here is a quick run through.

# We first create and switch to a new branch.

git branch participants
git checkout participants

touch participants.txt

# Edit the participants file using some text editor.

# You can swap back to the original version, called master, as follows.

git checkout master

# If you look at the folder my_local_repo, you will notice that the participants file is gone.
# You are now looking at the original files. Go back to the participants.

git checkout participants

# Add the file to the staging area (i.e. the files you want to track) and take a snapshot using commit.

git add participants.txt
git commit -m 'added list of participants'

# Once we have tested our branch and everything seems fine we can "merge" it with the master branch.
# A merge unifies the two verions.

git checkout master
git merge participants

# Now we can remove the participants branch and check the status and log of our project.

git branch -d participants
git status
git log
