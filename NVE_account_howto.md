# Working with the NVE account on github

To be able to interact with the NVE account on github, you first need to make sure that you have been added to the [group](https://github.com/orgs/NVE/people)

If not, ask one the 4 administrators of the NVE account:
- [Karsten MÃ¼ller](https://github.com/kmunve)
- [Ragnar Ekker](https://github.com/ragnarekker)
- [Jan Magnusson](https://github.com/jmgnve)
- [Peter Johan Olsen](https://github.com/nve-appdev)

They can help modify rights from "read only" to "write" or "admin" for specific existing repositories.
However, if you want to add a repository (already existing on your account), or create a new one on the NVE account, 
you can do it without their assitance by following the process below:

## Creating an NVE repository from scratch

Please feel free to add repositories of your current work under the NVE account, even if the code is not quite mature and still in development.
It is however good to indicate the (im)maturity of the project by including, for example, *work in progress* in the README.

To create an NVE repository from scratch, just click on the *new repository* button and make sure you have selected NVE as the owner. 
Be careful, the repository is set to *private* by default.
The newly created repository will sit on the NVE account but you will be its administrator. You will thus have access to the *settings* tab
and will be able to add collaborators, protect branches, etc.

## Transfering an existing repository from your account onto NVE

#### What you should do
Create a **completely empty** repository (no readme, no gitignore, nothing!)
By clicking on *create*, a new page will come asking if you want to import code. Click on *import code* and paste the link to your personal repository here.
If by mistake you have created a private repository, you can always change the settings to make it public.

#### What you should not do 

Going to the settings tab of your repository, clicking on transfer ownership, and transfering it to NVE:
***you will lose your administrator rights*** and will not have access to the *settings* tab anymore.
